/**
 * This plug-in will add automatic detection for currency columns to 
 * DataTables. Note that only $, £ and € symbols are detected with this code,
 * but it is trivial to add more or change the current ones. This is best used
 * in conjunction with the currency sorting plug-in.
 * 
 * DataTables 1.10+ has currency sorting abilities built-in and will be
 * automatically detected. As such this plug-in is marked as deprecated, but
 * might be useful when working with old versions of DataTables.
 *
 *  @name Currency
 *  @summary Detect data of numeric type with a leading currency symbol.
