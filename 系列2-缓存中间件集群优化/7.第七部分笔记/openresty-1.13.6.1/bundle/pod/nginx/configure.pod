configure - Building nginx from Sources


=head1



The build is configured using the C<configure> command.
It defines various aspects of the system, including the methods nginx
is allowed to use for connection processing.
At the end it creates a F<Makefile>.
The C<configure> command supports the following parameters:

=over




=item *



C<--prefix=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>defines
a directory that will keep server files.
This same directory will also be used for all relative paths set by
C<configure> (except for paths to libraries sources)
and in the F<nginx.conf> configuration file.
It is set to the F<E<sol>usrE<sol>localE<sol>nginx> directory by default.





=item *



C<--sbin-path=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of an nginx executable file.
This name is used only during installation.
By default the file is named
F<I<C<prefix>>E<sol>sbinE<sol>nginx>.





=item *



C<--conf-path=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of an F<nginx.conf> configuration file.
If needs be, nginx can always be started with a different configuration file,
by specifying it in the command-line parameter
C<-c I<C<file>>>.
By default the file is named
F<I<C<prefix>>E<sol>confE<sol>nginx.conf>.





=item *



C<--pid-path=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of an nginx.pid file that will store the process ID
of the main process.
After installation, the file name can always be changed in the
F<nginx.conf> configuration file using the
L<ngx_core_module> directive.
By default the file is named
F<I<C<prefix>>E<sol>logsE<sol>nginx.pid>.





=item *



C<--error-log-path=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of the primary error, warnings, and diagnostic file.
After installation, the file name can always be changed in the
F<nginx.conf> configuration file using the
L<ngx_core_module> directive.
By default the file is named
F<I<C<prefix>>E<sol>logsE<sol>error.log>.





=item *



C<--http-log-path=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of the primary request log file of the HTTP server.
After installation, the file name can always be changed in the
F<nginx.conf> configuration file using the
L<ngx_http_log_module> directive.
By default the file is named
F<I<C<prefix>>E<sol>logsE<sol>access.log>.





=item *



C<--build=I<C<name>>>E<mdash>sets
an optional nginx build name.





=item *



C<--user=I<C<name>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of an unprivileged user whose credentials will be used
by worker processes.
After installation, the name can always be changed in the
F<nginx.conf> configuration file using the
L<ngx_core_module> directive.
The default user name is nobody.





=item *



C<--group=I<C<name>>>E<mdash>sets
the name of a group whose credentials will be used
by worker processes.
After installation, the name can always be changed in the
F<nginx.conf> configuration file using the
L<ngx_core_module> directive.
By default, a group name is set to the name of an unprivileged user.





=item *



C<--with-select_module>


C<--without-select_module>E<mdash>enables or disables
building a module that allows the server to work with the
C<select> method.
This module is built automatically if the platform does not appear
to support more appropriate methods such as kqueue, epoll, or E<sol>devE<sol>poll.





=item *



C<--with-poll_module>


C<--without-poll_module>E<mdash>enables or disables
building a module that allows the server to work with the
C<poll> method.
This module is built automatically if the platform does not appear
to support more appropriate methods such as kqueue, epoll, or E<sol>devE<sol>poll.





=item *



C<--without-http_gzip_module>E<mdash>disables building a module
that L<compresses responses|ngx_http_gzip_module>
of an HTTP server.
The zlib library is required to build and run this module.





=item *



C<--without-http_rewrite_module>E<mdash>disables building a
module that allows an HTTP server to
L<redirect requests and change URI
of requests|ngx_http_rewrite_module>.
The PCRE library is required to build and run this module.





=item *



C<--without-http_proxy_module>E<mdash>disables building an
HTTP server L<proxying module|ngx_http_proxy_module>.





=item *



C<--with-http_ssl_module>E<mdash>enables building a module
that adds the L<HTTPS protocol
support|ngx_http_ssl_module> to an HTTP server.
This module is not built by default.
The OpenSSL library is required to build and run this module.





=item *



C<--with-pcre=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the path to the sources of the PCRE library.
The library distribution (version
4.4E<mdash>8.41) needs to be downloaded from the
L<PCRE|http://www.pcre.org> site and extracted.
The rest is done by nginx’s C<.E<sol>configure> and
C<make>.
The library is required for regular expressions support in the
L<ngx_http_core_module> directive
and for the
L<ngx_http_rewrite_module|ngx_http_rewrite_module>
module.





=item *



C<--with-pcre-jit>E<mdash>builds the PCRE library with
“just-in-time compilation” support (1.1.12, the
L<ngx_core_module> directive).





=item *



C<--with-zlib=I<C<path>>>E<mdash>sets
the path to the sources of the zlib library.
The library distribution (version
1.1.3E<mdash>1.2.11) needs to be downloaded from the
L<zlib|http://zlib.net> site and extracted.
The rest is done by nginx’s C<.E<sol>configure> and
C<make>.
The library is required for the
L<ngx_http_gzip_module|ngx_http_gzip_module> module.





=item *



C<--with-cc-opt=I<C<parameters>>>E<mdash>sets
additional parameters that will be added to the CFLAGS variable.
When using the system PCRE library under FreeBSD,
C<--with-cc-opt="-I E<sol>usrE<sol>localE<sol>include">
should be specified.
If the number of files supported by C<select> needs to be
increased it can also be specified here such as this:
C<--with-cc-opt="-D FD_SETSIZE=2048">.





=item *



C<--with-ld-opt=I<C<parameters>>>E<mdash>sets
additional parameters that will be used during linking.
When using the system PCRE library under FreeBSD,
C<--with-ld-opt="-L E<sol>usrE<sol>localE<sol>lib">
should be specified.

Example of parameters usage (all of this needs to be typed in one line):

    
    ./configure
        --sbin-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx
        --conf-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx.conf
        --pid-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx.pid
        --with-http_ssl_module
        --with-pcre=../pcre-8.41
        --with-zlib=../zlib-1.2.11







After configuration,
nginx is compiled and installed using C<make>.
