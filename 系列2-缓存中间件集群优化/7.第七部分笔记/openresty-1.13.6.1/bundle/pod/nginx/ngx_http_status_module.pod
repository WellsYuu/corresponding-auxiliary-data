ngx_http_status_module - Module ngx_http_status_module




=head1



The C<ngx_http_status_module> module provides
access to various status information.

B<NOTE>

This module was superseded by the
L<ngx_http_api_module|ngx_http_api_module> module
in 1.13.0.







B<NOTE>

This module is available as part of our
commercial subscription.





=head1 Example Configuration

        }
    
        proxy_cache_path /data/nginx/cache_backend keys_zone=<emphasis>cache_backend</emphasis>:10m;
    
        server {
            server_name backend.example.com;
    
            location / {
                proxy_pass  http://backend;
                proxy_cache cache_backend;
    
                health_check;

        }
    
        server {
            listen 127.0.0.1;
    
            location /upstream_conf {
                upstream_conf;
            }
    
            location /status {
                status;
            }
    
            location = /status.html {
            }
        }
    }
    
    stream {
        upstream <emphasis>backend</emphasis> {
            <emphasis>zone</emphasis> stream_backend 64k;
    
            server backend1.example.com:12345 weight=5;
            server backend2.example.com:12345;
        }
    
        server {
            listen      127.0.0.1:12345;
            proxy_pass  backend;
            <emphasis>status_zone server_backend;</emphasis>
            health_check;
        }
    }







Examples of status requests with this configuration:

    
    http://127.0.0.1/status
    http://127.0.0.1/status/nginx_version
    http://127.0.0.1/status/caches/cache_backend
    http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams
    http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend
    http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1
    http://127.0.0.1/status/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight
    http://127.0.0.1/status/stream
    http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams
    http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend
    http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1
    http://127.0.0.1/status/stream/upstreams/backend/peers/1/weight







The simple monitoring page is shipped with this distribution,
accessible as “C<E<sol>status.html>” in the default configuration.
It requires the locations “C<E<sol>status>” and
“C<E<sol>status.html>” to be configured as shown above.




=head1 Directives

=head2 status




B<context:> I<location>





The status information will be accessible from the surrounding location.
Access to this location should be
L<limited|ngx_http_core_module>.

B<syntax:> status_format I<C<jsonp> [I<C<callback>>]>


B<default:> I<json>


B<context:> I<http>

Alternatively, data may be output as JSONP.
The I<C<callback>> parameter specifies the name of a callback function.
The value can contain variables.
If parameter is omitted, or the computed value is an empty string,
then “C<ngx_status_jsonp_callback>” is used.

B<context:> I<server>





Enables collection of virtual
L<http|ngx_http_core_module>
or
L<stream|ngx_stream_core_module>
