=head1 Name

ngx.re - Lua API for convenience utilities for C<ngx.re>.


=head1 Status

This Lua module is currently considered experimental.


=head1 Synopsis


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    -- split
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b,c,d", ",")
    --> res is now {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
    
    -- opt
    ngx_re.opt("jit_stack_size", 128 * 1024)
    --> the PCRE jit stack can now handle more complex regular expressions




=head1 Description

This Lua module provides a Lua API which implements convenience utilities for
the C<ngx.re> API.




=head1 Methods

All the methods of this module are static (or module-level). That is, you do
not need an object (or instance) to call these methods.




=head2 split

B<syntax:> I<res, err = ngx_re.split(subject, regex, options?, ctx?, max?, res?)>

Splits the C<subject> string using the Perl compatible regular expression
C<regex> with the optional C<options>.

This function returns a Lua (array) table (with integer keys) containing the
splitted values.

In case of error, C<nil> will be returned as well as a string describing the
error.

When C<regex> contains a sub-match capturing group, and when such a match is
found, the first submatch capture will be inserted in between each splitted
value, like so:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b,c,d", "(,)")
    -- res is now {"a", ",", "b", ",", "c", ",", "d"}

When C<regex> is empty string C<"">, the C<subject> will be split into chars,
like so:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("abcd", "")
    -- res is now {"a", "b", "c", "d"}

The optional C<ctx> table argument can be a Lua table holding an optional C<pos>
field. When the C<pos> field in the C<ctx> table argument is specified,
C<ngx_re.split> will start splitting the C<subject> from that index:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b,c,d", ",", nil, {pos = 5})
    -- res is now {"c", "d"}

The optional C<max> argument is a number that when specified, will prevent
C<ngx_re.split> from adding more than C<max> matches to the C<res> array:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b,c,d", ",", nil, nil, 3)
    -- res is now {"a", "b", "c,d"}

Specifying C<max <= 0> disables this behavior, meaning that the number of
results won't be limited.

The optional 6th argument C<res> can be a table that C<ngx_re.split> will re-use
to hold the results instead of creating a new one, which can improve
performance in hot code paths. It is used like so:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local my_table = {"hello world"}
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b,c,d", ",", nil, nil, nil, my_table)
    -- res/my_table is now {"a", "b", "c", "d"}

When provided with a C<res> table, C<ngx_re.split> won't clear the table
for performance reasons, but will rather insert a trailing C<nil> value
when the split is completed:


    local ngx_re = require "ngx.re"
    
    local my_table = {"W", "X", "Y", "Z"}
    
    local res, err = ngx_re.split("a,b", ",", nil, nil, nil, my_table)
    -- res/my_table is now {"a", "b", nil, "Z"}

When the trailing C<nil> is not enough for your purpose, you should
clear the table yourself before feeding it into the C<split> function.




=head2 opt

B<syntax:> I<ngx_re.opt(option, value)>

Allows changing of regex settings. Currently, it can only change the
C<jit_stack_size> of the PCRE engine, like so:


     init_by_lua_block { require "ngx.re".opt("jit_stack_size", 200 * 1024) }
    
     server {
         location /re {
             content_by_lua_block {
                 -- full regex and string are taken from https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/8278
                 local very_long_string = [[71.163.72.113 - - [30/Jul/2014:16:40:55 -0700] ...]]
                 local very_complicated_regex = [[([\d\.]+) ([\w.-]+) ([\w.-]+) (\[.+\]) ...]]
                 local from, to, err = ngx.re.find(very_long_string, very_complicated_regex, "jo")
    
                 -- with the regular jit_stack_size, we would get the error 'pcre_exec() failed: -27'
                 -- instead, we get a match
                 ngx.print(from .. "-" .. to) -- prints '1-1563'
             }
         }
     }

The C<jit_stack_size> cannot be set to a value lower than PCRE's default of 32K.

This method requires the PCRE library enabled in Nginx.

This feature was first introduced in the C<v0.1.12> release.
