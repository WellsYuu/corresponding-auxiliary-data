      <h4>Caution: You can break stuff here</h4>
      Be careful in here, these settings are for very advanced users only.
      Tweaks you make here can break large portions of Kibana. Some of these
      settings may be undocumented, unsupported or experimental. If a field has
      a default value, blanking the field will reset it to its default which
      may be unacceptable given other configuration directives. Deleting a
      custom setting will permanently remove it from Kibana's config.
