# Welcome to filebeat 6.0.0

Filebeat sends log files to Logstash or directly to Elasticsearch.

## Getting Started

To get started with filebeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on your localhost first. After that, start filebeat with:

     ./filebeat -c filebeat.yml -e

This will start the beat and send the data to your Elasticsearch instance. To load the dashboards for filebeat into Kibana, run:

    ./filebeat setup -e
