/**
 * Often a list of data which has titles in it (books, albums etc) will have
 * the word "the" at the start of some individual titles, which you don't want
 * to include in your sorting order. This plug-in will strip the word "the"
 * from the start of a string and sort on what is left.
 *
 *  @name Anti-"the"
 *  @summary Sort with the prefixed word `dt-string The` removed, if present
