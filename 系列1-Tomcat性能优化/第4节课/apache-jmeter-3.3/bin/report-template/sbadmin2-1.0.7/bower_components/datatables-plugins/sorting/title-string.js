/**
 * Just like the _hidden title numeric sorting_ plug-in, this sorting plug-in
 * will take the information to be sorted on from the title attribute of a span
 * element. The only difference is that it is string based sorting rather than
 * numeric.
 *
 * Note that the HTML5 `data-sort` attribute can be [used to supply sorting data
 * to DataTables](//datatables.net/manual/orthogonal-data) and is preferable to
 * using this method, which is therefore marked as deprecated.
 * 
 *  @name Hidden title string sorting
 *  @summary Sort data as a string based on an attribute on an empty element.
 *  @author [Allan Jardine](http://sprymedia.co.uk)
 *  @deprecated
 *
 *  @example
 *    $('#example').dataTable( {
 *       columnDefs: [
 *         { type: 'title-string', targets: 0 }
 *       ]
 *    } );
