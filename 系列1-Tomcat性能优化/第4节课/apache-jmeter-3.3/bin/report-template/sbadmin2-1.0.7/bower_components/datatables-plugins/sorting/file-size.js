/**
 * When dealing with computer file sizes, it is common to append a post fix
 * such as KB, MB or GB to a string in order to easily denote the order of
 * magnitude of the file size. This plug-in allows sorting to take these
 * indicates of size into account. A counterpart type detection plug-in 
 * is also available.
 *
 *  @name File size
 *  @summary Sort abbreviated file sizes correctly (8MB, 4KB etc)
