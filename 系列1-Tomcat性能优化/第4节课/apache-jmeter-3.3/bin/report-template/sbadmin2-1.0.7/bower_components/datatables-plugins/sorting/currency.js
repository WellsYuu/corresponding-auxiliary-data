/**
 * This plug-in will provide numeric sorting for currency columns (either 
 * detected automatically with the currency type detection plug-in or set 
 * manually) while taking account of the currency symbol ($ or Â£ by default).
 *
 * DataTables 1.10+ has currency sorting abilities built-in and will be
 * automatically detected. As such this plug-in is marked as deprecated, but
 * might be useful when working with old versions of DataTables.
 *
 *  @name Currency
 *  @summary Sort data numerically when it has a leading currency symbol.
