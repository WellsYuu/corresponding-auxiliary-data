/**
 * It is not uncommon for non-English speaking countries to use a comma for a
 * decimal place. This sorting plug-in shows how that can be taken account of in
 * sorting by adding the type `numeric-comma` to DataTables. A type detection 
 * plug-in for this sorting method is provided below.
 * 
 * Please note that the 'Formatted numbers' type detection and sorting plug-ins
 * offer greater flexibility that this plug-in and should be used in preference
 * to this method.
 *
 *  @name Commas for decimal place
 *  @summary Sort numbers correctly which use a common as the decimal place.

 *         { type: 'numeric-comma', targets: 0 }
