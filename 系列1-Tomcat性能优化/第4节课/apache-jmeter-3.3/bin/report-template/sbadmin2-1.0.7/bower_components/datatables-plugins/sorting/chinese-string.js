/**
 * Sorting in Javascript for Chinese Character. The Chinese Characters are
 * sorted on the radical and number of strokes. This plug-in performs sorting
 * for Chinese characters using the Javascript [localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare)
 * function.
 *
 * Please note that `localeCompare` is not implemented in the same way in all
 * browsers, potentially leading to different results (particularly in IE).
