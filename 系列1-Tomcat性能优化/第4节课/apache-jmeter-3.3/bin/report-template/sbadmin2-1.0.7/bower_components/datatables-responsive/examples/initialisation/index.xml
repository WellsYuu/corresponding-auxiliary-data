<title lib="Responsive">Initialisation</title>

<info><![CDATA[

Responsive can be run on a DataTable in a number of different ways:

* By adding the class `responsive` or `dt-responsive` to the `-tag table`
* Using the `r-init responsive` option in the DataTables initialisation
* Use the `$.fn.dataTable.Responsive` constructor.

This set of examples demonstrates these initialisation options.
