<info><![CDATA[

By default, when Responsive collapses a table, it will show an option for the end user to expand the row, showing the details of the hidden columns in a child row. This can be disabled using the `r-init responsive.details` option and setting it to `false`, as shown in the example below. In this case the hidden data is not directly accessible to the end user.
