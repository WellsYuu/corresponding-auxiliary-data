<title lib="Responsive">Vertical scrolling</title>

<info><![CDATA[

This example shows Responsive in use with the `dt-init scrollY` option to present a scrolling table (instead of using paging as the other Responsive examples do). Responsive will automatically work with the table in such a configuration.

Responsive can be used with `dt-init scrollX`, however it is relatively pointless as Responsive will remove columns to ensure that there is no horizontal scrolling!
