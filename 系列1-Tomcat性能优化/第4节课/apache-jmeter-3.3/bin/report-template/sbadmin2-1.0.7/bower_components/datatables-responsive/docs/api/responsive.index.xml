		<parameter type="node|jQuery" name="li">
			The `-tag li` node (or a jQuery collection containing the node) to get the cell index for.

	<description>
		When working with Responsive's details rows it can often be useful to obtain a reference to the cell, row or column that the data shown in the details row comes from. This method provides that ability, returning an object that can be used as a `dt-type cell-selector` with the `dt-api cell()` method.

		Note that this method requires the default renderer to be used for `r-init responsive.details.renderer`. If a custom method is used it will not be able to obtain the information required to calculate the indexes.
