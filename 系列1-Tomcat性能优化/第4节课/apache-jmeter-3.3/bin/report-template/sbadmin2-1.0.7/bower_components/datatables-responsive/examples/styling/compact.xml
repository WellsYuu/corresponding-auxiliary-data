<info><![CDATA[

DataTables' [default stylesheet](http://datatables.net/manual/styling/classes) has a number number of features available that can be enabled by including a class name on the DataTable. One of those options is `compact` which displays the DataTable with less whitespace padding that might other be used to increase the information density of the table. Responsive's own style has support for this `compact` styling as showing in this example.
