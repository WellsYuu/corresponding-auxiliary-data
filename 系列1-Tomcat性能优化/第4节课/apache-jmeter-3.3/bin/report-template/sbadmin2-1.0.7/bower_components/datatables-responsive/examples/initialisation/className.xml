<info><![CDATA[

The easiest way to initialise the Responsive extension for DataTables is simply to add the class `-string responsive` to the table's class name. When the DataTable is initialised the Responsive extension will automatically enable itself on these tables.

The may also use the class `dt-responsive` to perform the same action, since `responsive` may be used in your stylesheet, or may have some other meaning in a CSS framework being used (for example Bootstrap).
