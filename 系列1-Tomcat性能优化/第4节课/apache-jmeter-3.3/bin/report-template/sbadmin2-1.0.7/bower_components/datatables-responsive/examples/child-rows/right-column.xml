<info><![CDATA[

When using the `column` child row control type, Responsive has the ability to use any column or element as the show / hide control for the row details. This is provided through the `r-init responsive.details.target` option, which can be either a column index, or a jQuery selector.

This example shows the last column in the table being used as the control column.
