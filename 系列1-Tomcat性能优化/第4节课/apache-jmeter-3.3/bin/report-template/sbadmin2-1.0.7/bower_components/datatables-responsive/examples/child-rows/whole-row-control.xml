<title lib="Responsive">Whole row child row control</title>

<info><![CDATA[

When using the `column` details type in Responsive the `r-init responsive.details.target` option provides the ability to control what element is used to show / hide the child rows when the table is collapsed.

This example uses the `tr` selector to have the whole row act as the control.
