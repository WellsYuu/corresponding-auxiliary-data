/**
 *
 * <p>
 *     Standard controller implementations for the portlet MVC framework that
 *     comes with Spring. Provides both abstract base classes and concrete
 *     implementations for often seen use cases.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     A {@code Controller} - as defined in this package - is analogous to a Struts
 *     {@code Action}. Usually {@code Controllers} are JavaBeans
 *     to allow easy configuration. Controllers define the {@code C} from so-called
 *     MVC paradigm and can be used in conjunction with the {@link
 *     org.springframework.web.portlet.ModelAndView ModelAndView} to achieve interactive
 *     applications. The view might be represented by a HTML interface, but, because of
 *     model and the controller being completely independent of the view, PDF views are
 *     possible, as well as for instance Excel views.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Especially useful to read, while getting into the Spring MVC framework
 *     are the following:
 *     <ul>
 *         <li><a href="Controller.html">Controller</a></li>
 *         <li><a href="SimpleFormController.html">BaseCommandController</a></li>
 *         <li><a href="ParameterizableViewController.html">ParameterizableViewController</a></li>
 *     </ul>
 * </p>
