/**
 * <p>Concrete FormController implementation that provides configurable
 * form and success views, and an onSubmit chain for convenient overriding.
 * Automatically resubmits to the form view in case of validation errors,
 * and renders the success view in case of a valid submission.</p>
 *
 * <p>The workflow of this Controller does not differ much from the one described
 * in the {@link AbstractFormController AbstractFormController}. The difference
 * is that you do not need to implement {@link #showForm showForm} and
 * {@link #processFormSubmission processFormSubmission}: A form view and a
 * success view can be configured declaratively.</p>
 *
 * <p><b><a name="workflow">Workflow
 * (<a href="AbstractFormController.html#workflow">in addition to the superclass</a>):</b><br>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Call to {@link #processFormSubmission processFormSubmission} which inspects
 *      the {@link org.springframework.validation.Errors Errors} object to see if
 *      any errors have occurred during binding and validation.</li>
 *  <li>If errors occured, the controller will return the configured formView,
 *      showing the form again (possibly rendering according error messages).</li>
 *  <li>If {@link #isFormChangeRequest isFormChangeRequest} is overridden and returns
 *      true for the given request, the controller will return the formView too.
 *      In that case, the controller will also suppress validation. Before returning the formView,
 *      the controller will invoke {@link #onFormChange}, giving sub-classes a chance
 *      to make modification to the command object.
 *      This is intended for requests that change the structure of the form,
 *      which should not cause validation and show the form in any case.</li>
 *  <li>If no errors occurred, the controller will call
 *      {@link #onSubmit(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object, BindException) onSubmit}
 *      using all parameters, which in case of the default implementation delegates to
 *      {@link #onSubmit(Object, BindException) onSubmit} with just the command object.
 *      The default implementation of the latter method will return the configured
 *      {@code successView}. Consider implementing {@link #doSubmitAction} doSubmitAction
 *      for simply performing a submit action and rendering the success view.</li>
 *  </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The submit behavior can be customized by overriding one of the
 * {@link #onSubmit onSubmit} methods. Submit actions can also perform
 * custom validation if necessary (typically database-driven checks), calling
 * {@link #showForm(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, BindException) showForm}
 * in case of validation errors to show the form view again.</p>
