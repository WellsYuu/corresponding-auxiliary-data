 * Provides standard View and ViewResolver implementations,

 * <p>Application developers don't usually need to implement views,
 * as the framework provides standard views for JSPs, Velocity,
 * XSLT, etc. However, the ability to implement custom views easily
 * by subclassing the AbstractView class in this package can be
 * very helpful if an application has unusual view requirements.
