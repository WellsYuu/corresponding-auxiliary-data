 * Extends {@code HandlerInterceptor} with a callback method invoked during
 * asynchronous request handling.
 *
 * <p>When a handler starts asynchronous request handling, the DispatcherServlet
 * exits without invoking {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion}, as it
 * normally does, since the results of request handling (e.g. ModelAndView)
 * will. be produced concurrently in another thread. In such scenarios,
 * {@link #afterConcurrentHandlingStarted(HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, Object)}
 * is invoked instead allowing implementations to perform tasks such as cleaning
 * up thread bound attributes.
 *
 * <p>When asynchronous handling completes, the request is dispatched to the
 * container for further processing. At this stage the DispatcherServlet invokes
 * {@code preHandle}, {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} as usual.
