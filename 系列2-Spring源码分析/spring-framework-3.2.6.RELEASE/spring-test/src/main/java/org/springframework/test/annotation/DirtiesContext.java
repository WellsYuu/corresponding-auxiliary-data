 * <li>after the current test, when declared at the method level</li>
 * <li>after each test method in the current test class, when declared at the
 * class level with class mode set to {@link ClassMode#AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD

 * <li>after the current test class, when declared at the class level with class
 * mode set to {@link ClassMode#AFTER_CLASS AFTER_CLASS}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Use this annotation if a test has modified the context &mdash; for example, by
 * replacing a bean definition or changing the state of a singleton bean.
 * Subsequent tests will be supplied a new context.

 * such annotated method as well as after the entire class. If the
 * {@link ClassMode} is set to {@link ClassMode#AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD
 * AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD}, the context will be marked dirty after each test
 * method in the class.
