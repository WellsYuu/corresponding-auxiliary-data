/**
 * {@link org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor} for accessing a Burlap service.
 * Supports authentication via username and password.
 * The service URL must be an HTTP URL exposing a Burlap service.
 *
 * <p>Burlap is a slim, XML-based RPC protocol.
 * For information on Burlap, see the
 * <a href="http://www.caucho.com/burlap">Burlap website</a>
 *
 * <p>Note: There is no requirement for services accessed with this proxy factory
 * to have been exported using Spring's {@link BurlapServiceExporter}, as there is
 * no special handling involved. As a consequence, you can also access services that
 * have been exported using Caucho's {@link com.caucho.burlap.server.BurlapServlet}.
