/**
 * {@code DeferredResult} provides an alternative to using a {@link Callable}
 * for asynchronous request processing. While a {@code Callable} is executed
 * concurrently on behalf of the application, with a {@code DeferredResult} the
 * application can produce the result from a thread of its choice.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses can extend this class to easily associate additional data or
 * behavior with the {@link DeferredResult}. For example, one might want to
 * associate the user used to create the {@link DeferredResult} by extending the
 * class and adding an additional property for the user. In this way, the user
 * could easily be accessed later without the need to use a data structure to do
 * the mapping.
 *
 * <p>An example of associating additional behavior to this class might be
 * realized by extending the class to implement an additional interface. For
 * example, one might want to implement {@link Comparable} so that when the
 * {@link DeferredResult} is added to a {@link PriorityQueue} it is handled in
 * the correct order.
