 * Remoting classes for transparent Java-to-Java remoting via HTTP invokers.
 * Uses Java serialization just like RMI, but provides the same ease of setup
 * as Caucho's HTTP-based Hessian and Burlap protocols.
 *
 * <p><b>HTTP invoker is the recommended protocol for Java-to-Java remoting.</b>
 * It is more powerful and more extensible than Hessian and Burlap, at the
 * expense of being tied to Java. Neverthelesss, it is as easy to set up as
 * Hessian and Burlap, which is its main advantage compared to RMI.
