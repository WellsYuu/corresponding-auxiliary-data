/**
 * {@link ParameterizedRowMapper} implementation that converts a row into a new instance
 * of the specified mapped target class. The mapped target class must be a top-level class
 * and it must have a default or no-arg constructor.
 *
 * <p>Uses Java 5 covariant return types to override the return type of the {@link #mapRow}
 * method to be the type parameter {@code T}.
 *
 * <p>Column values are mapped based on matching the column name as obtained from result set
 * metadata to public setters for the corresponding properties. The names are matched either
 * directly or by transforming a name separating the parts with underscores to the same name
 * using "camel" case.
 *
 * <p>Mapping is provided for fields in the target class for many common types, e.g.:
 * String, boolean, Boolean, byte, Byte, short, Short, int, Integer, long, Long,
 * float, Float, double, Double, BigDecimal, {@code java.util.Date}, etc.
 *
 * <p>The mapper can be configured to use the primitives default value when mapping null values
 * by setting the '{@link #setPrimitivesDefaultedForNullValue primitivesDefaultedForNullValue}'
 * flag to 'true'.
 *
 * <p>To facilitate mapping between columns and fields that don't have matching names,
 * try using column aliases in the SQL statement like "select fname as first_name from customer".
 *
 * <p>Please note that this class is designed to provide convenience rather than high performance.
 * For best performance consider using a custom RowMapper.
