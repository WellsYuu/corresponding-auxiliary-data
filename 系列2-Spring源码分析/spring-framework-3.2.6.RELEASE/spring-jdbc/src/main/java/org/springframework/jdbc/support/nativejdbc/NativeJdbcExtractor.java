/**
 * Interface for extracting native JDBC objects from wrapped objects coming from
 * connection pools. This is necessary to allow for casting to native implementations
 * like {@code OracleConnection} or {@code OracleResultSet} in application
 * code, for example to create Blobs or to access vendor-specific features.
 *
 * <p>Note: Setting a custom {@code NativeJdbcExtractor} is just necessary
 * if you intend to cast to database-specific implementations like
 * {@code OracleConnection} or {@code OracleResultSet}.
 * Otherwise, any wrapped JDBC object will be fine, with no need for unwrapping.
 *
 * <p>Note: To be able to support any pool's strategy of native ResultSet wrapping,
 * it is advisable to get both the native Statement <i>and</i> the native ResultSet
 * via this extractor. Some pools just allow to unwrap the Statement, some just to
 * unwrap the ResultSet - the above strategy will cover both. It is typically
 * <i>not</i> necessary to unwrap the Connection to retrieve a native ResultSet.
 *
 * <p>When working with a simple connection pool that wraps Connections but not
 * Statements, a {@link SimpleNativeJdbcExtractor} is often sufficient. However,
 * some pools (like Jakarta's Commons DBCP) wrap <i>all</i> JDBC objects that they
 * return: Therefore, you need to use a specific {@code NativeJdbcExtractor}
 * (like {@link CommonsDbcpNativeJdbcExtractor}) with them.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate} can properly apply a
 * {@code NativeJdbcExtractor} if specified, unwrapping all JDBC objects
 * that it creates. Note that this is just necessary if you intend to cast to
 * native implementations in your data access code.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.springframework.jdbc.support.lob.OracleLobHandler},
 * the Oracle-specific implementation of Spring's
 * {@link org.springframework.jdbc.support.lob.LobHandler} interface, requires a
 * {@code NativeJdbcExtractor} for obtaining the native {@code OracleConnection}.
 * This is also necessary for other Oracle-specific features that you may want
 * to leverage in your applications, such as Oracle InterMedia.
