/**
 * Convenient base class for EJB 2.x MDBs.
 * Doesn't require JMS, as EJB 2.1 MDBs are no longer JMS-specific;
 * see the {@link AbstractJmsMessageDrivenBean} subclass.
 *
 * <p>This class ensures that subclasses have access to the
 * MessageDrivenContext provided by the EJB container, and implement
 * a no-arg {@code ejbCreate()} method as required by the EJB
 * specification. This {@code ejbCreate()} method loads a BeanFactory,
 * before invoking the {@code onEjbCreate()} method, which is
 * supposed to contain subclass-specific initialization.
 *
 * <p>NB: We cannot use final methods to implement EJB API methods,
 * as this violates the EJB specification. However, there should be
 * no need to override the {@code setMessageDrivenContext} or
 * {@code ejbCreate()} methods.
 *
 * @author Rod Johnson
 * @deprecated as of Spring 3.2, in favor of implementing EJBs in EJB 3 style
