/**
 * Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of
 * the <b>ResourceLoader</b> (typically the ApplicationContext) that it runs in.
 * This is an alternative to a full ApplicationContext dependency via the
 * ApplicationContextAware interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that Resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties
 * of type Resource, populated via Strings with automatic type conversion by
 * the bean factory. This removes the need for implementing any callback
 * interface just for the purpose of accessing a specific file resource.
 *
 * <p>You typically need a ResourceLoader when your application object has
 * to access a variety of file resources whose names are calculated. A good
 * strategy is to make the object use a DefaultResourceLoader but still
 * implement ResourceLoaderAware to allow for overriding when running in an
 * ApplicationContext. See ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource for an example.
 *
 * <p>A passed-in ResourceLoader can also be checked for the
 * <b>ResourcePatternResolver</b> interface and cast accordingly, to be able
 * to resolve resource patterns into arrays of Resource objects. This will always
 * work when running in an ApplicationContext (the context interface extends
 * ResourcePatternResolver). Use a PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver as default.
 * See also the {@code ResourcePatternUtils.getResourcePatternResolver} method.
 *
 * <p>As alternative to a ResourcePatternResolver dependency, consider exposing
 * bean properties of type Resource array, populated via pattern Strings with
 * automatic type conversion by the bean factory.
