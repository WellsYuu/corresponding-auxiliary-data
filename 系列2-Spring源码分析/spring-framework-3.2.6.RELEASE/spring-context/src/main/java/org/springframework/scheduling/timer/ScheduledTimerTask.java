/**
 * JavaBean that describes a scheduled {@link TimerTask}, consisting of the
 * {@link TimerTask} itself or a {@link Runnable} to create a {@link TimerTask}
 * for and a delay plus period. The period needs to be specified; there is
 * no point in a default for it.
 *
 * <p>The JDK's {@link java.util.Timer} facility does not offer sophisticated
 * scheduling options such as cron expressions. Consider using Quartz for
 * such advanced needs.
 *
 * <p>Note that the {@link java.util.Timer} mechanism uses a {@link TimerTask}
 * instance that is shared between repeated executions, in contrast to Quartz
 * which creates a new Job instance for each execution.
