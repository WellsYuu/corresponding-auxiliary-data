/**
 * Enables Spring's asynchronous method execution capability, similar to functionality
 * found in Spring's {@code <task:*>} XML namespace. To be used on @{@link Configuration}
 * classes as follows:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableAsync
 * public class AppConfig {
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public MyAsyncBean asyncBean() {
 *         return new MyAsyncBean();
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * where {@code MyAsyncBean} is a user-defined type with one or methods annotated
 * with @{@link Async} (or any custom annotation specified by the {@link #annotation()}
 * attribute).
 *
 * <p>The {@link #mode()} attribute controls how advice is applied; if the mode is
 * {@link AdviceMode#PROXY} (the default), then the other attributes control the behavior
 * of the proxying.
 *
 * <p>Note that if the {@linkplain #mode} is set to {@link AdviceMode#ASPECTJ}, then
 * the {@link #proxyTargetClass()} attribute is obsolete. Note also that in this case the
 * {@code spring-aspects} module JAR must be present on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>By default, a {@link org.springframework.core.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor
 * SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor} will be used to process async method invocations. To
 * customize this behavior, implement {@link AsyncConfigurer} and
 * provide your own {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor Executor} through the
 * {@link AsyncConfigurer#getAsyncExecutor() getExecutor()} method.
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * &#064;Configuration
 * &#064;EnableAsync
 * public class AppConfig implements AsyncConfigurer {
 *
 *     &#064;Bean
 *     public MyAsyncBean asyncBean() {
 *         return new MyAsyncBean();
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {
 *         ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
 *         executor.setCorePoolSize(7);
 *         executor.setMaxPoolSize(42);
 *         executor.setQueueCapacity(11);
 *         executor.setThreadNamePrefix("MyExecutor-");
 *         executor.initialize();
 *         return executor;
 *     }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For reference, the example above can be compared to the following Spring XML
 * configuration:
 * <pre class="code">
 * {@code
 * <beans>
 *     <task:annotation-driven executor="myExecutor"/>
 *     <task:executor id="myExecutor" pool-size="7-42" queue-capacity="11"/>
 *     <bean id="asyncBean" class="com.foo.MyAsyncBean"/>
 * </beans>
 * }</pre>
 * the examples are equivalent save the setting of the <em>thread name prefix</em> of the
 * Executor; this is because the the {@code task:} namespace {@code executor} element does
 * not expose such an attribute. This demonstrates how the code-based approach allows for
 * maximum configurability through direct access to actual componentry.
 *
 * <p>Note: In the above example the {@code ThreadPoolTaskExecutor} is not a fully managed
 * Spring Bean. Add the {@code @Bean} annotation to the {@code getAsyncExecutor()} method
 * if you want a fully managed bean. In such circumstances it is no longer necessary to
 * manually call the {@code executor.initialize()} method as this will be invoked
 * automatically when the bean is initialized.
