 * intention of reducing the surface area of java files within this
 * package.  This allows developers to think about tests first, and deal
 * with these second class testing artifacts on an as-needed basis.
 *
 * Types here should be defined as package-private top level classes in
 * order to avoid needing to fully qualify, e.g.: _TestTypes$Foo.
