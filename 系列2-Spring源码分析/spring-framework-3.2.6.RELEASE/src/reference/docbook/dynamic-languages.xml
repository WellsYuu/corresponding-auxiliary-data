      <title>Why only these languages?</title>
      <para>
        The supported languages were chosen because a) the languages
        have a lot of traction in the Java enterprise community, b) no requests were made
        for other languages within the Spring 2.0 development timeframe, and
        c) the Spring developers were most familiar with them.
      </para>
      <para>
        There is nothing stopping the inclusion of further languages though. If you want
        to see support for &lt;<emphasis>insert your favourite dynamic language here</emphasis>&gt;,
        you can always raise an issue on Spring's
        <link xl:href="http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/secure/Dashboard.jspa">JIRA</link>
        page (or implement such support yourself).
      </para>
    </sidebar>
    <para>Spring 2.0 introduces comprehensive support for using classes and objects that have
    been defined using a dynamic language (such as JRuby) with Spring.
    This support allows you to write any number of classes in a supported dynamic language,
    and have the Spring container transparently instantiate, configure and dependency inject the
    resulting objects.</para>
    <para>The dynamic languages currently supported are:</para>

      Fully working examples of where this dynamic language support can be immediately useful
      are described in <xref linkend="dynamic-language-scenarios"/>.

    <para>
      <emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Only the specific versions as listed above are supported

  <section xml:id="dynamic-language-a-first-example">
    <title>A first example</title>
    <para>
      This bulk of this chapter is concerned with describing the dynamic language support
      in detail. Before diving into all of the ins and outs of the dynamic language support,
      let's look at a quick example of a bean defined in a dynamic language.
      The dynamic language for this first bean is Groovy (the basis of this example
      was taken from the Spring test suite, so if you want to see equivalent examples
      in any of the other supported languages, take a look at the source code).
    </para>
    <para>
      Find below the <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> interface that the
      Groovy bean is going to be implementing, and note that this interface is defined
      in plain Java. Dependent objects that are injected with a reference to the
      <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> won't know that the underlying
      implementation is a Groovy script.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[package org.springframework.scripting;

public interface Messenger {

    String getMessage();
}]]></programlisting>
    <para>
      Here is the definition of a class that has a dependency on the
      <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> interface.
    </para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[package org.springframework.scripting;

public class DefaultBookingService implements BookingService {

    private Messenger messenger;

    public void setMessenger(Messenger messenger) {
        this.messenger = messenger;
    }

    public void processBooking() {
        // use the injected Messenger object...
    }
}]]></programlisting>
    <para>Here is an implementation of the <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> interface
    in Groovy.</para>
    <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[// from the file 'Messenger.groovy'
package org.springframework.scripting.groovy;

// import the Messenger interface (written in Java) that is to be implemented
import org.springframework.scripting.Messenger

// define the implementation in Groovy
class GroovyMessenger implements Messenger {

    String message
}]]></programlisting>
    <para>
      Finally, here are the bean definitions that will effect the injection of the
      Groovy-defined <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> implementation into
      an instance of the <classname>DefaultBookingService</classname> class.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        To use the custom dynamic language tags to define dynamic-language-backed beans,
        you need to have the XML Schema preamble at the top of your Spring XML
        configuration file. You also need to be using a Spring
        <interfacename>ApplicationContext</interfacename> implementation as your
        IoC container. Using the dynamic-language-backed beans with a plain
        <interfacename>BeanFactory</interfacename> implementation is supported,
        but you have to manage the plumbing of the Spring internals to do so.

    <para>
      Please note that this chapter does not attempt to explain the syntax and
      idioms of the supported dynamic languages. For example, if you want to
      use Groovy to write certain of the classes in your application, then the
      assumption is that you already know Groovy. If you need further details
      about the dynamic languages themselves, please consult

            Define your dynamic-language-backed beans using the appropriate
            <literal>&lt;lang:language/&gt;</literal> element in the XML
            configuration (you can of course define such beans programmatically
            using the Spring API - although you will have to consult the source
            code for directions on how to do this as this type of advanced
            configuration is not covered in this chapter). Note this is an iterative
            step. You will need at least one bean definition per dynamic
            language source file (although the same dynamic language source
            file can of course be referenced by multiple bean definitions).
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
        The first two steps (testing and writing your dynamic language source files)
        are beyond the scope of this chapter. Refer to the language specification
        and / or reference manual for your chosen dynamic language and crack on with
        developing your dynamic language source files. You <emphasis>will</emphasis>
        first want to read the rest of this chapter though, as Spring's dynamic language
        support does make some (small) assumptions about the contents of your dynamic
        language source files.

          <para>
            All of the configuration examples in this chapter make use of the
            new XML Schema support that was added in Spring 2.0.
          </para>
          <para>It is possible to forego the use of XML Schema and stick with the old-style
          DTD based validation of your Spring XML files, but then you lose out
          on the convenience offered by the <literal>&lt;lang:language/&gt;</literal>
          element. See the Spring test suite for examples of the older style
          configuration that doesn't require XML Schema-based validation
          (it is quite verbose and doesn't hide any of the underlying Spring
          implementation from you).</para>
        </sidebar>
        <para>
          The final step involves defining dynamic-language-backed bean definitions,
          one for each bean that you want to configure (this is no different from
          normal JavaBean configuration). However, instead of specifying the
          fully qualified classname of the class that is to be instantiated and
          configured by the container, you use the <literal>&lt;lang:language/&gt;</literal>
          element to define the dynamic language-backed bean.
        </para>
        <para>
          Each of the supported languages has a corresponding

          The exact attributes and child elements that are available for
          configuration depends on exactly which language the bean has been
          defined in (the language-specific sections below provide the full
          lowdown on this).

        <title>Refreshable beans</title>
        <para>
          One of the (if not <emphasis>the</emphasis>) most compelling value adds
          of the dynamic language support in Spring is the
          <firstterm>'refreshable bean'</firstterm> feature.
        </para>
        <para>
          A refreshable bean is a dynamic-language-backed bean that with a small
          amount of configuration, a dynamic-language-backed bean can monitor
          changes in its underlying source file resource, and then reload itself
          when the dynamic language source file is changed (for example when a
          developer edits and saves changes to the file on the filesystem).
        </para>
        <para>
          This allows a developer to deploy any number of dynamic language source
          files as part of an application, configure the Spring container to create
          beans backed by dynamic language source files (using the mechanisms
          described in this chapter), and then later, as requirements change or
          some other external factor comes into play, simply edit a dynamic language
          source file and have any change they make reflected in the bean that is
          backed by the changed dynamic language source file. There is no need to
          shut down a running application (or redeploy in the case of a web application).
          The dynamic-language-backed bean so amended will pick up the new state
          and logic from the changed dynamic language source file.
        </para>

          <para>Please note that this feature is <emphasis>off</emphasis> by default.</para>

        <para>
          Let's take a look at an example to see just how easy it is to start using
          refreshable beans. To <emphasis>turn on</emphasis> the refreshable beans
          feature, you simply have to specify exactly <emphasis>one</emphasis>
          additional attribute on the <literal>&lt;lang:language/&gt;</literal> element
          of your bean definition. So if we stick with
          <link linkend="dynamic-language-a-first-example">the example</link> from earlier
          in this chapter, here's what we would change in the Spring XML configuration
          to effect refreshable beans:
        </para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<beans>

    ]]><lineannotation>&lt;!-- this bean is now 'refreshable' due to the presence of the 'refresh-check-delay' attribute --&gt;</lineannotation><![CDATA[
    <lang:groovy id="messenger"
          refresh-check-delay="5000" ]]><lineannotation>&lt;!-- switches refreshing on with 5 seconds between checks --&gt;</lineannotation><![CDATA[

    <bean id="bookingService" class="x.y.DefaultBookingService">
        <property name="messenger" ref="messenger" />
    </bean>

</beans>]]></programlisting>
        <para>
          That really is all you have to do. The <literal>'refresh-check-delay'</literal>
          attribute defined on the <literal>'messenger'</literal> bean definition
          is the number of milliseconds after which the bean will be refreshed with
          any changes made to the underlying dynamic language source file.
          You can turn off the refresh behavior by assigning a negative value
          to the <literal>'refresh-check-delay'</literal> attribute.
          Remember that, by default, the refresh behavior is disabled. If you don't
          want the refresh behavior, then simply don't define the attribute.
        </para>
        <para>
          If we then run the following application we can exercise the refreshable feature;
          please do excuse the <emphasis>'jumping-through-hoops-to-pause-the-execution'</emphasis>
          shenanigans in this next slice of code. The <literal>System.in.read()</literal>
          call is only there so that the execution of the program pauses while I (the author)
          go off and edit the underlying dynamic language source file so that the refresh will
          trigger on the dynamic-language-backed bean when the program resumes execution.</para>
        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;

          Let's assume then, for the purposes of this example, that all

          <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> implementations have to be
          changed such that the message is surrounded by quotes.
          Below are the changes that I (the author) make to the

          When the program executes, the output before the input pause will be
          <computeroutput>I Can Do The Frug</computeroutput>. After the change
          to the source file is made and saved, and the program resumes execution,
          the result of calling the <literal>getMessage()</literal> method on the
          dynamic-language-backed <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename> implementation
          will be <computeroutput>'I Can Do The Frug'</computeroutput> (notice
          the inclusion of the additional quotes).

        <para>
          It is important to understand that changes to a script will
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> trigger a refresh if the changes occur
          within the window of the <literal>'refresh-check-delay'</literal> value.
          It is equally important to understand that changes to the script are
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> actually 'picked up' until a method is called
          on the dynamic-language-backed bean. It is only when a method is called on a
          dynamic-language-backed bean that it checks to see if its underlying script
          source has changed. Any exceptions relating to refreshing the script
          (such as encountering a compilation error, or finding that the script
          file has been deleted) will result in a <emphasis>fatal</emphasis>
          exception being propagated to the calling code.
        </para>
        <para>
          The refreshable bean behavior described above does
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> apply to dynamic language source files
          defined using the <literal>&lt;lang:inline-script/&gt;</literal> element
          notation (see <xref linkend="dynamic-language-beans-inline" />).
          Additionally, it <emphasis>only</emphasis> applies to beans where
          changes to the underlying source file can actually be detected;
          for example, by code that checks the last modified date of a
          dynamic language source file that exists on the filesystem.

          More specifically, the <literal>&lt;lang:inline-script/&gt;</literal>

          possible to supply constructor arguments to dynamic-language-backed beans (and hence
          constructor-injection is not available for dynamic-language-backed beans).
          In the interests of making this special handling of constructors and
          properties 100% clear, the following mixture of code and configuration
          will <emphasis>not</emphasis> work.

        In keeping with the Spring philosophy of offering choice, Spring's
        dynamic language support also supports beans defined in the JRuby
        language. The JRuby language is based on the quite intuitive
        Ruby language, and has support for inline regular expressions, blocks
        (closures), and a whole host of other features that do make solutions
        for some domain problems a whole lot easier to develop.
      </para>
      <para>
        The implementation of the JRuby dynamic language support in Spring is
        interesting in that what happens is this: Spring creates a JDK dynamic
        proxy implementing all of the interfaces that are specified in the
        <literal>'script-interfaces'</literal> attribute value of the
        <literal>&lt;lang:ruby&gt;</literal> element (this is why
        you <emphasis>must</emphasis> supply at least one interface in the value
        of the attribute, and (accordingly) program to interfaces when using
        JRuby-backed beans).
      </para>
      <para>
        Let us look at a fully working example of using a JRuby-based bean. Here is
        the JRuby implementation of the <interfacename>Messenger</interfacename>
        interface that was defined earlier in this chapter (for your convenience it

      <para>
        Take note of the last line of that JRuby source (<literal>'RubyMessenger.new'</literal>).
        When using JRuby in the context of Spring's dynamic language support, you are encouraged
        to instantiate and return a new instance of the JRuby class that you want to use as a
        dynamic-language-backed bean as the result of the execution of your JRuby source. You
        can achieve this by simply instantiating a new instance of your JRuby class on the last
        line of the source file like so:
      </para>
      <programlisting language="ruby"><![CDATA[require 'java'

include_class 'org.springframework.scripting.Messenger'

# class definition same as above...

# instantiate and return a new instance of the RubyMessenger class
RubyMessenger.new]]></programlisting>
      <para>
        If you forget to do this, it is not the end of the world; this will however result in
        Spring having to trawl (reflectively) through the type representation of your JRuby class
        looking for a class to instantiate. In the grand scheme of things this will be so fast
        that you'll never notice it, but it is something that can be avoided by simply
        having a line such as the one above as the last line of your JRuby script. If you don't
        supply such a line, or if Spring cannot find a JRuby class in your script to instantiate
        then an opaque <classname>ScriptCompilationException</classname>
        will be thrown immediately after the source is executed by the JRuby
        interpreter. The key text that identifies this as the root cause of an
        exception can be found immediately below (so if your Spring container
        throws the following exception when creating your dynamic-language-backed bean
        and the following text is there in the corresponding stacktrace, this will hopefully
        allow you to identify and then easily rectify the issue):
      </para>
      <para>
      <computeroutput><![CDATA[org.springframework.scripting.ScriptCompilationException: Compilation of JRuby script returned '']]></computeroutput>
      </para>
      <para>
        To rectify this, simply instantiate a new instance of whichever class
        you want to expose as a JRuby-dynamic-language-backed bean (as shown above). Please
        also note that you can actually define as many classes and objects
        as you want in your JRuby script; what is important is that the
        source file as a whole must return an object (for Spring to configure).

      The possible scenarios where defining Spring managed beans in a scripting

      <title>Scripted Spring MVC Controllers</title>
      <para>
        One group of classes that may benefit from using dynamic-language-backed
        beans is that of Spring MVC controllers. In pure Spring MVC applications,
        the  navigational flow through a web application is to a large extent
        determined by code encapsulated within your Spring MVC controllers.
        As the navigational flow and other presentation layer logic of a web
        application needs to be updated to respond to support issues or changing
        business requirements, it may well be easier to effect any such required
        changes  by editing one or more dynamic language source files and seeing
        those changes being immediately reflected in the state of a running
        application.
      </para>
      <para>
        Remember that in the lightweight architectural model espoused by projects
        such as Spring, you are typically aiming to have a really
        <emphasis>thin</emphasis> presentation layer, with all the meaty business
        logic of an application being contained in the domain and service layer
        classes. Developing Spring MVC controllers as dynamic-language-backed beans
        allows you to change presentation layer logic by simply editing and saving
        text files; any changes to such dynamic language source files will (depending
        on the configuration) automatically be reflected in the beans that are backed

      <title>AOP - advising scripted beans</title>
      <para>
        It is possible to use the Spring AOP framework to advise scripted beans.
        The Spring AOP framework actually is unaware that a bean that is being
        advised might be a scripted bean, so all of the AOP use cases and functionality
        that you may be using or aim to use will work with scripted beans. There is
        just one (small) thing that you need to be aware of when advising scripted
        beans... you cannot use class-based proxies, you must use
        <link linkend="aop-proxying">interface-based proxies</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        You are of course not just limited to advising scripted beans... you can
        also write aspects themselves in a supported dynamic language and use such
        beans to advise other Spring beans. This really would be an advanced use of
        the dynamic language support though.

      <title>Scoping</title>
      <para>
        In case it is not immediately obvious, scripted beans can of course be scoped
        just like any other bean. The <literal>scope</literal> attribute on the
        various <literal>&lt;lang:language/&gt;</literal> elements allows you to
        control the scope of the underlying scripted bean, just as it does with a
        regular bean. (The default scope is
        <link linkend="beans-factory-scopes-singleton">singleton</link>, just as it
        is with 'regular' beans.)

      Some of the more active members of the Spring community have also added support for
      a number of additional dynamic languages above and beyond the ones covered in this
      chapter. While it is possible that such third party contributions may be added to the
      list of languages supported by the main Spring distribution, your best bet for seeing
      if your favourite scripting language is supported is the
      <link xl:href="https://springmodules.dev.java.net/">Spring Modules project</link>.
