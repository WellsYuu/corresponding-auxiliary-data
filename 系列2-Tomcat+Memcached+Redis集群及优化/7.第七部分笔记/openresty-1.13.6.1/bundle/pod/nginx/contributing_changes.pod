=head1 Getting Sources



L<Mercurial|https://www.mercurial-scm.org> is used
to store source code.
The L<repository|http://hg.nginx.org/nginx> can be cloned
with the following command:

    
    hg clone http://hg.nginx.org/nginx






=head1 Formatting Changes



Changes should be formatted according to the code style used by nginx.
Code formatting should not rely on such editor features like syntax
highlighting or automatic line breaking.
Below are some basic rules:

=over




=item *

maximum text width is 80 characters



=item *

indentation is four spaces



=item *

no tabs



=item *

logical code blocks in a file are separated with two empty lines



=back


Examine how existing nginx sources are formatted and mimic this style
in your code.
Changes will more likely be accepted if style corresponds to the surrounding
code.





Commit the changes to create a Mercurial
L<changeset|https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ChangeSet>.
Please ensure that the specified
L<e-mail|https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/QuickStart#Setting_a_username>
address and real name of the changeâ€™s author are correct.





The commit message should have a single-line synopsis followed by verbose
description after an empty line.
It is desirable that the first line is no longer than 67 symbols.
The resulting changeset as a patch can be obtained using the
C<hg export> command:
