=head1 NAME

ngx_http_limit_conn_module - Module ngx_http_limit_conn_module




=head1



The C<ngx_http_limit_conn_module> module is used to
limit the number of connections per the defined key, in
particular, the number of connections from a single IP address.





Not all connections are counted.
A connection is counted only if it has a request processed by the server
and the whole request header has already been read.




=head1 Example Configuration




    
    http {
        limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;
    
        ...
    
        server {
    
            ...
    
            location /download/ {
                limit_conn addr 1;
            }






=head1 Directives

=head2 limit_conn


B<syntax:> limit_conn I<I<C<zone>> I<C<number>>>



B<context:> I<http>


B<context:> I<server>


B<context:> I<location>





Sets the shared memory zone
and the maximum allowed number of connections for a given key value.
When this limit is exceeded, the server will return the
error
in reply to a request.
For example, the directives

    
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;
    
    server {
        location /download/ {
            limit_conn addr 1;
        }


allow only one connection per an IP address at a time.

B<NOTE>

In HTTPE<sol>2 and SPDY, each concurrent request is considered a separate connection.






There could be several C<limit_conn> directives.
For example, the following configuration will limit the number
of connections to the server per a client IP and, at the same time,
the total number of connections to the virtual server:

    
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=perip:10m;
    limit_conn_zone $server_name zone=perserver:10m;
    
    server {
        ...
        limit_conn perip 10;
        limit_conn perserver 100;
    }








These directives are inherited from the previous level if and
only if there are no
C<limit_conn>
directives on the current level.







=head2 limit_conn_log_level


B<syntax:> limit_conn_log_level I<
C<info> E<verbar>
C<notice> E<verbar>
C<warn> E<verbar>
C<error>>


B<default:> I<error>


B<context:> I<http>


B<context:> I<server>


B<context:> I<location>



This directive appeared in version 0.8.18.





Sets the desired logging level for cases when the server
limits the number of connections.







=head2 limit_conn_status


B<syntax:> limit_conn_status I<I<C<code>>>


B<default:> I<503>


B<context:> I<http>


B<context:> I<server>


B<context:> I<location>



This directive appeared in version 1.3.15.





Sets the status code to return in response to rejected requests.







=head2 limit_conn_zone


B<syntax:> limit_conn_zone I<
    I<C<key>>
    C<zone>=I<C<name>>:I<C<size>>>



B<context:> I<http>





Sets parameters for a shared memory zone
that will keep states for various keys.
In particular, the state includes the current number of connections.
The I<C<key>> can contain text, variables, and their combination.
Requests with an empty key value are not accounted.

B<NOTE>

Prior to version 1.7.6, a I<C<key>> could contain exactly one variable.

Usage example:

    
    limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;


Here, a client IP address serves as a key.
Note that instead of C<$remote_addr>, the
C<$binary_remote_addr> variable is used here.
The C<$remote_addr> variable’s size can
vary from 7 to 15 bytes.
The stored state occupies either
32 or 64 bytes of memory on 32-bit platforms and always 64
bytes on 64-bit platforms.
The C<$binary_remote_addr> variable’s size
is always 4 bytes for IPv4 addresses or 16 bytes for IPv6 addresses.
The stored state always occupies 32 or 64 bytes
on 32-bit platforms and 64 bytes on 64-bit platforms.
One megabyte zone can keep about 32 thousand 32-byte states
or about 16 thousand 64-byte states.
If the zone storage is exhausted, the server will return the
error
to all further requests.







=head2 limit_zone


B<syntax:> limit_zone I<
    I<C<name>>
    I<C<$variable>>
    I<C<size>>>



B<context:> I<http>





This directive was made obsolete in version 1.1.8
and was removed in version 1.7.6.
An equivalent L</limit_conn_zone> directive
with a changed syntax should be used instead:

B<NOTE>

C<limit_conn_zone>
I<C<$variable>>
C<zone>=I<C<name>>:I<C<size>>;
