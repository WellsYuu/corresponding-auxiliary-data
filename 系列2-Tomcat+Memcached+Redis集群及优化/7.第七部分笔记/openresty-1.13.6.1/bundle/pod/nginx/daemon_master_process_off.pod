B<Q:>
Can I run nginx with "daemon off" or "master_process off" settings
in a production environment?

First of all, both "daemon onE<verbar>off" and "master_process onE<verbar>off" directives were
intended to be used primarily for nginx code development.





While many people use "daemon off" in production it wasnâ€™t really meant for
that. Since version 1.0.9 it is now quite safe to run nginx in production
with "daemon off", though. Bear in mind that non-stop upgrade is not an
option with "daemon off".





In a development environment, using "master_process off", nginx can run in
the foreground without the master process and can be terminated simply
with ^C (SIGINT). This is somewhat similar to running Apache with
an 'X' command-line option. However you should NEVER run nginx in production
with "master_process off".
