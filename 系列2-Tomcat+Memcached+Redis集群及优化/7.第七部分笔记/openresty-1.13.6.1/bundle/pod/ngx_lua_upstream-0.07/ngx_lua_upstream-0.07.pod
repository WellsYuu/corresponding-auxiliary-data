=head1 Functions




=head2 get_upstreams

C<syntax: names = upstream.get_upstreams()>

Get a list of the names for all the named upstream groups (i.e., explicit C<upstream {}> blocks).

Note that implicit upstream groups created by C<proxy_pass> and etc are excluded.




=head2 get_servers

C<syntax: servers = upstream.get_servers(upstream_name)>

Get configurations for all the servers in the specified upstream group. Please one server may take multiple addresses when its server name can be resolved to multiple addresses.

The return value is an array-like Lua table. Each table entry is a hash-like Lua table that takes the following keys:


=over


=item *

addr

socket address(es). can be either a Lua string or an array-like Lua table of Lua strings.

=item *

backup

=item *

fail_timeout

=item *

max_fails

=item *

name

=item *

weight


=back




=head2 get_primary_peers

C<syntax: peers = upstream.get_primary_peers(upstream_name)>

Get configurations for all the primary (non-backup) peers in the specified upstream group.

The return value is an array-like Lua table for all the primary peers. Each table entry is a (nested) hash-like Lua table that takes the following keys:


=over


=item *

current_weight

=item *

effective_weight

=item *

fail_timeout

=item *

fails

=item *

id

Identifier (ID) for the peer. This ID can be used to reference a peer in a group in the peer modifying API.

=item *

max_fails

=item *

name

Socket address for the current peer

=item *

weight

=item *

accessed

Timestamp for the last access (in seconds since the Epoch)

=item *

checked

Timestamp for the last check (in seconds since the Epoch)

=item *

down

Holds true if the peer has been marked as "down", otherwise this key is not present

=item *

conns

Number of active connections to the peer (this requires NGINX 1.9.0 or above).


=back




=head2 get_backup_peers

C<syntax: peers = upstream.get_backup_peers(upstream_name)>

Get configurations for all the backup peers in the specified upstream group.

The return value has the same structure as L<get_primary_peers> function.




=head2 set_peer_down

C<syntax: ok, err = upstream.set_peer_down(upstream_name, is_backup, peer_id, down_value)>

Set the "down" (boolean) attribute of the specified peer.

To uniquely specify a peer, you need to specify the upstream name, whether or not it is a backup peer, and the peer id (starting from 0).

Note that this method only changes the peer settings in the current Nginx worker
process. You need to synchronize the changes across all the Nginx workers yourself if you
want a server-wide change (for example, by means of L<ngx_lua|https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxshareddict>'s L<ngx.shared.DICT|https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#ngxshareddict>).

Below is an example. Consider we have a "bar" upstream block in C<nginx.conf>:


    upstream bar {
        server 127.0.0.2;
        server 127.0.0.3 backup;
        server 127.0.0.4 fail_timeout=23 weight=7 max_fails=200 backup;
    }

then


    upstream.set_peer_down("bar", false, 0, true)

will turn down the primary peer corresponding to C<server 127.0.0.2>.

Similarly,


    upstream.set_peer_down("bar", true, 1, true)

will turn down the backup peer corresponding to C<server 127.0.0.4 ...>.

You can turn on a peer again by providing a C<false> value as the 4th argument.




=head2 current_upstream_name

C<syntax: name = upstream.current_upstream_name()>

Returns the name of the proxied upstream for the current request.
If there is no upstream for this request (no C<proxy_pass> call), or this
function is called in a phase prior to the content phase, then the return value
will be C<nil>. If a port is explicitly included in the upstream definition or
C<proxy_pass> directive, it will be included in the return value of this function.

Example:


    -- upstream my_upstream { ... }
    -- proxy_pass http://my_upstream;
    upstream.current_upstream_name() --> my_upstream
    
    -- proxy_pass http://example.com:1234;
    upstream.current_upstream_name() --> example.com:1234

Note that implicit upstreams created by C<proxy_pass> are included, contrary to
the output of C<upstream.get_upstreams()>.




=head1 TODO


=over


=item *

Add API to add or remove servers to existing upstream groups.

=head1 Installation

This module is bundled and enabled by default in the L<OpenResty|http://openresty.org> bundle. And you are recommended to use OpenResty.


=over


=item 1.

Grab the nginx source code from L<nginx.org|http://nginx.org/>, for example,
the version 1.11.2 (see L<nginx compatibility>),

=item 2.

then grab the source code of the L<ngx_lua|https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#installation> as well as its dependencies like L<LuaJIT|http://luajit.org/download.html>.

=item 3.

and finally build the source with this module:


=back


    wget 'http://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.11.2.tar.gz'
    tar -xzvf nginx-1.11.2.tar.gz
    cd nginx-1.11.2/
    
    # assuming your luajit is installed to /opt/luajit:
    export LUAJIT_LIB=/opt/luajit/lib
    
    # assuming you are using LuaJIT v2.1:
    export LUAJIT_INC=/opt/luajit/include/luajit-2.1
    
    # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
    ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
        --with-ld-opt="-Wl,-rpath,$LUAJIT_LIB" \
        --add-module=/path/to/lua-nginx-module \
        --add-module=/path/to/lua-upstream-nginx-module
    
    make -j2
    make install

Starting from NGINX 1.9.11, you can also compile this module as a dynamic module, by using the C<--add-dynamic-module=PATH> option instead of C<--add-module=PATH> on the
C<./configure> command line above. And then you can explicitly load the module in your C<nginx.conf> via the L<load_module|http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#load_module>
directive, for example,


    load_module /path/to/modules/ngx_http_lua_upstream_module.so;
